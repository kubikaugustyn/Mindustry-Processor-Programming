    <h1>Native library</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The language contains a native library, an abstraction from the raw instructions. Many functions are just
            wrappers around instructions, but some implement a lot more functionality. Don't be scared, many functions
            have a JITted implementation that uses a little weird syntax. It's here mostly for fun, to see how it works,
            not for using it. :D You can just call the function and not care about the details, that's its purpose. Due
            to the nature of these native functions, I cannot definitely determine the number of return variables
            required, so it's about experimenting on your own. But it should be intuitive.</p>
        <p>
            You may have already noticed that I'm using the word function, even though it's actually a macro. Sorry for
            any confusion caused. If you have an idea on how to implement a real function call, feel free to contact me.
            I was thinking about using <a href="https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/4468"
                                          target="_blank">an eval instruction</a> to store the call stack, but Anuken
            didn't implement it nor did he share his opinion about the subject.
        </p>
        <p>If you don't see a certain function, it may be because you're on a different version. Change it in settings
            to see it:
            <button id="open-settings">Open settings</button>
        </p>
        <div id="native-library"></div>
    </div>

                This language includes a native library that wraps raw instructions into more convenient macros. Some
                are
                simple wrappers, others do much more. Advanced ones use a quirky JIT-style syntax—don't worry about it,
                it's
                mostly experimental. Just call the function and let it handle the details. Return values aren't always
                obvious, so a bit of trial and error is expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technically, these are macros, not real functions—sorry if that’s confusing.
                I’ve considered implementing real function calls using
                <a href="https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/4468" target="_blank">an eval
                    instruction</a>
                for a call stack, but that’s still just an idea until it's supported by the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a function seems missing, it might depend on your selected game version. You can switch versions
                here:
                <button id="open-settings">Open settings</button>
            </p>
            <div id="native-library">Rendering...</div>
