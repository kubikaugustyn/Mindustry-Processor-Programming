Link this to multiple thorium reactors
When the reactor reaches less than 10 cryofluid, it will be disabled.
As you can see, complicated MLOG is simple with MPPL.

for (POSITIVE_INTEGER i = 0; i < @links; i = i + 1){
    BUILDING reactor = getlink(i)
    if (@type of reactor != @thorium-reactor) continue
    control.enabled(reactor, @cryofluid in reactor > 10)
